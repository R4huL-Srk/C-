Yes, it is possible to use the #include<bits/stdc++.h> header file in C++ to compile and run this program. However,
it is generally not recommended to use this header file as it includes all the standard headers in the C++ Standard Library, 
which can slow down the compilation process and increase the memory usage of the program.
Regarding the code itself, it correctly calculates the maximum and minimum values of two integers a and b without using any
conditional statements or comparison operators. It does this by using the formula:
Maximum = (a + b + abs(a - b)) / 2
Minimum = (a + b - abs(a - b)) / 2
The abs function is used to calculate the absolute difference between a and b. The program then uses the calculated values to print the maximum and minimum values of a and b.
Here's the corrected code:
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
int main()
{
    int a = 15, b = 20;
    std::cout << "max = " << ((a + b) + abs(a - b)) / 2 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "min = " << ((a + b) - abs(a - b)) / 2 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
THIS WILL BE THE OUTPUT
max = 20
min = 15
